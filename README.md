# Array-Binary-search-Tree-BST-
The main objective of this project is to store the binary search tree using an array data structure 
as presented below.  
 
ArrayBST: 
The binary search tree data structure can be stored using a number of ways including pointers 
(_left and _right tree pointers), with a single dimensional array (mainly used for storing a 
complete binary tree), and the array of left and right index (call this ArrayBST) approach. The 
ArrayBST is similar to the array implementation of a linked list discussed in the textbook. 
 
In the ArrayBST, we will have an array (or vector) of ArrayBTNode objects. The size of the 
array or vector is K, which can be specified in the constructor with default value of lets say 20. 
The root of the binary tree is placed at an index position say x with a value of say 100.  Let us 
also assume that the root node has a left child with a value of 50 and a right child with a value of 
200.  The left child (or the right child) can be at any index position of the array.  Let these 
positions be y (left index) and z (right index), respectively.  We have to store this information at 
the root node located at index position x.  An example of this structure is given below.  
 position _info _left _right 
0          100.  2.    4 
1          NULL -1    -1 
2          50    3     6 
3          10   -1    -1 
4         200   -1     5 
5         400    8    -1 
6          60.  -1    -1 
7.         NULL -1.  -1 
8         300   -1    -1 
The left child (resp. right child) of the root is at index position 2 (resp. 4).  The left child of node 
with value 50 is at index position 3 while its right child with a value of 60 is at index position 6.  
Positions 1 and 7 are empty slots (because _info is set to NULL) wherein new nodes can be 
placed. The algorithms to remove a node will place NULL at appropriate index positions.  When 
the left (resp. right) index is a -1 then it implies that the left child of that node is empty.  
 
Insertion and Removal 
 
In order to insert a new node, first we need to find an index position with _info set to NULL. The 
time to complete this task in the worst case will be equal to the size of the vector. But a simple 
technique to keep track of the free positions is to use a stack. You can use the STL stack (call it 
freeLocations) for this purpose. When the BinarySearchTree is created you will initialize this 
stack with empty positions 0 through maximum number of nodes minus one. That is, will push 
values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, onto the stack where n is the maximum number of nodes allowed in the 
binary tree. So, you will have n – 1 as the first index position to store the first insertion node.  
Whenever you need to insert a node into the binary search tree you pop an index position from 
the stack. When a node is removed, we need to push the corresponding position onto the stack.  
 
search 
 
Search returns the index of the ArrayBTNode object in the vector. Sequential search cannot be 
used to implement search method. Binary Search is the way to go about this search.  
 
ostream operator and DisplayRaw 
 
The overloaded ostream operator should print both the preorder and inorder traversals. You 
will also implement a DisplayRaw method that prints out the following information stored in the 
data structure:  
 
(a)  Position, *_info, _left, _right in the array (only for the rows with data stored) 
(b) The content of the stack
